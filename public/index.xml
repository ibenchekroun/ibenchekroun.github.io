      <description>IMDb Review-bombing: from Ghostbusters (2016) to She-Hulk (2022) Every year, a few movies (and TV shows) garner an unusually high volume of terrible ratings on IMDb. The first time I took note of such “review bombing” was in 2016 with the release of the female-led Ghostbusters (2016) reboot (source). The ratings were so unusual that IMDb decided to evaluate the film’s rating with an “an alternate weighting calculation” and it now has a solid 6.</description>

      <description>This dashboard calculates your NBA fantasy team&amp;rsquo;s performance against an opposing team, given the players you input for both teams and given the week of performance. It&amp;rsquo;s purely historical data; the performance shows you how your team would have faired in a past week. I found it useful personally for deciding whether I should drop a specific player to pick up another specific player, in preparation for my next week&amp;rsquo;s matchup.</description>

      <description>This dashboard was made for a friend who was was in the middle of a stressful (but good) dilemma of having two summer job offers from the United Nations: one was with a Bangkok-based team, and the other based in NYC.
It&amp;rsquo;s a tool that is probably not relevant to your life, but in the future I plan on generalizing it to any 2 jobs, as well as other types of decisions: which of 2 restaurants to eat at, which of 2 shows to watch.</description>
