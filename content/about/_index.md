Hi, I'm Ismail.

Currently I am completing an MSc in Statistics at the University of Toronto.     

I like basketball, comedy and movies, which I am trying to integrate into my passion for data science.

Having just recently scraped 26,999 movies' IMDb data, I'm excited to dig in and share cool findings on [here](/post).
I also have data dashboard or app ideas every once in a while that I would add to the [portfolio](/portfolio). 

For now, feel free to check out the [first data analysis](/post/IMDb-review-bombing) to come out fresh of the IMDb data and leave comments (am interested in hearing feedback and/or any ideas you may have).
