      <description>IMDb Review-bombing: from Ghostbusters (2016) to She-Hulk (2022) Every year, a few movies (and TV shows) garner an unusually high volume of terrible ratings on IMDb. The first time such “review bombing” caught my attention was in 2016 with the release of the female-led Ghostbusters (2016) reboot. The ratings were so irregular that IMDb decided to employ an “an alternate weighting calculation” and it now has a solid 6.9/10.</description>

      <description>This dashboard calculates your NBA fantasy team&amp;rsquo;s performance against an opposing team, given the players you input for both teams and given the week of performance. It&amp;rsquo;s purely historical data; the performance shows you how your team would have faired in a past week. I found it useful personally for deciding whether I should drop a specific player to pick up another specific player, in preparation for my next week&amp;rsquo;s matchup.</description>

      <description>This dashboard was made for a friend who was was in the middle of a stressful (but good) dilemma of having two summer job offers from the United Nations: one was with a Bangkok-based team, and the other based in NYC.
It&amp;rsquo;s a tool that is probably not relevant to your life, but in the future I plan on generalizing it to any 2 jobs, as well as other types of decisions: which of 2 restaurants to eat at, which of 2 shows to watch.</description>
